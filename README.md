# Multi-Source Traffic Scene Understanding Using Deep Learning

Traffic scene understanding is critical for modern urban planning, intelligent transportation systems, and emergency response. This project explores deep learning techniques to tackle key aspects of traffic analysis, namely:

- **Road Extraction**
- **Vehicle Detection**
- **Accident Recognition**

By processing diverse imaging sources — such as aerial and surveillance imagery — the project aims to build reliable pipelines capable of analyzing and interpreting complex traffic environments.

Traditional traffic monitoring systems often fall short in providing real-time, comprehensive insights into road conditions, vehicle movements, and accident occurrences. This project aims to harness deep learning techniques to bridge these gaps, enhancing traffic safety and efficiency through intelligent analysis of diverse visual data sources.

In this project, we aim to develop deep learning-driven solutions for comprehensive traffic scene understanding, focusing on:

- **Road Extraction**
- **Vehicle Detection**
- **Accident Recognition**

across diverse imaging sources.
